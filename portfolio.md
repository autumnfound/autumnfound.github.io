# My portfolio
On this page, you'll find some references to some of the projects that I've worked on, both in a professional capacity and as part of my personal development. Currently below is my uploaded personal projects. When possible, I'll update this page to contain more and more of my work and responsibilities!

## This site!
{% include carousel.html name="personal_projects" %}
This site was built from scratch using GitHub pages in order to showcase some of my development chops, as well as to make a more personalized experience for my site. Some of the technologies and strategies used on this site include:
 - Responsive, mobile first web design
 - Usage of GitHub Pages CMS, which uses Jekyll and Shopify's Liquid engine to render pages
 - Custom SCSS for theming on top of standard Bootstrap libraries
 
The source of this site can be found in my GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/autumnfound/autumnfound.github.io">autumnfound.github.io</a> project.
